Raw data is available for reference in the `data` directory. All data in the form necessary for the analysis is found in the `analysis` directory. To replicate the analysis, open the `analysis.Rproj` file in RStudio, then within RStudio open `analysis.Rmd` (the markdown-annotated analysis script). RStudio will prompt you to install any missing R libraries. Once these are present, you can press the "Knit" button to run the entire script and generate a pdf report or you can select one of the options under the "Run" button to operate the script more interactively. Some of the pre-processing of the data is slow, so the first time you run the script it will take a long time. The script saves the pre-processed data (see note under the heading "Generated Files" in `analysis.Rmd`) so that subsequent runs will be much quicker.
