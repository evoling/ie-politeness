Latin
=====

1. Definite and indefinite articles
-----------------------------------
"In regard to internal syntax, perhaps the most salient difference between Latin and Romance is the absence in Latin of articles, both definite amd indefinite" (Vincent, 1988: 52-53).

2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns
------------------------------------------
"[...] all the Romance languages have a system of relative pronouns which continues the Latin QUI series, and the standard languages at least continue the strategy of not marking the positino of a relativised item by a resumptive pronoun" (Vincent, 1988: 55). 

3. 'Have' perfect
-----------------
All tenses were expressed synthetically in Latin although the present perfect CANTAVIT-type "came increasingly to be expressed =through the grammaticalisation of the periphrasis HABET CANTATUM (> Fr. *a chant√©*, It. *ha cantato*, etc.)" (Vincent, 1988: 56).

4. Participial passive
----------------------
"[...] in Latin the passive was principally an inflectional category; it is only in the perfective that the periphrasis CANTATUM EST 'it has been sung' makes an appearance." (Vincent, 1988: 58).

5. Dative external possessors
-----------------------------


6. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation
------------------------------------------------
"The Latin distaste for negative attraction - by which a negative element sparks off a string of agreeing neagtives - is reflected in the attitudes of most grammarians of western vernaculars" (Posner, 1996: 148). This quote seems to suggest that Latin possessed but one negative item per clause.

7. Relative-based equative constructions
----------------------------------------


8. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers
-----------------------------------------------------
For example, "non-reflexive third person pronouns were frequently left unexpressed both as subject and object" (Vincent, 1988: 42).

9. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation
----------------------------------------
