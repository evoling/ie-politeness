Basque
======

1. Definite and indefinite articles
-----------------------------------
"There are two articles, the so-called definite article *-a* (singular), *-ak* (plural), and the so-called indefinite article *bat*. The first of these is used more broadly than its name would suggest, the second more narrowly." (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 118). The definite article is a bound morpheme and the indefinite is identical to 'one' and is the singular of 'some' so is not really an article in the SAE sense. 

2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns
------------------------------------------
"Different relativization strategies are used in Basque. The main distinction is the one separating ordinary embedded relatives from appositive and extraposed relatives with relative pronouns. This second kind [...] is a marked one, [...]." (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 762pp).
	
3. 'Have' perfect
-----------------
"The prefective present [present perfect] is formed with the perfective participle and the present form of the indicative auxiliaries ['to be, to have'], e.g.: *joan naiz* 'I have gone', *erosi dut* 'I have bought (it)'." (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 257).

4. Participial passive
----------------------
There is no evidence in the source consulted to suggets that a passive, participial or otherwise, exists in Basque.

5. Dative external possessors
-----------------------------
"The dative argument can represent either a hidden possessor or a goal (a true argument of the verb)." (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 418). Constructions with the genitive are also possible, with notable semantic differences.

6. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation
------------------------------------------------
Positive polarity items such as 'anybody, anything' require clausemate verbal negation, but are not themselves inherently negative. (See Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 540-542).

7. Relative-based equative constructions
----------------------------------------
"In a comparative phrase, the order is standard-pivot-adjective, and the pivot is [...] *bezain* 'as...as'." (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 140). 

8. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers
-----------------------------------------------------
Examples in the source consulted suggest that personal pronouns are not obligatory since verbal marking and context are explicit enough to retrieve that information. 

9. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation
----------------------------------------
"There are no true reflexive pronouns; instead, reflexive noun phrases are formed by combining the genitive of an intensive personal pronoun with *buru* 'head' and the definite article *-a*." (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 159). The intensive personal pronouns are most typically used when a pronoun is in focus, but also as topicalised noun phrases (Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina (eds.), 2003: 152).
