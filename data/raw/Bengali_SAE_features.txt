Bengali
=======

1. Definite and indefinite articles
-----------------------------------
"It is convenient to describe referential definiteness phenomena in Bangla in terms of the use of classifiers and other devices [...]. Nominal constructions distribute In/Definiteness information over three points: DemQ, Dem[onstrative] and Q[uantifier] choice; [...]." (Dasgupta, 2003: 379).

2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns
------------------------------------------
"A complement clause is marked either by an opening particle /je/, typical of Indo-European, or by a closing quotative /bole/ [...], which is formally the conjunctive of /bal/ say, typical of Dravidian." (Dasgupta, 2003: 377).

3. 'Have' perfect
-----------------
The present perfect is a synthetic form, also termed "half-loose" by Dasgupta (2003: 369). The perfect form of the verb is formed from the perfect stem of hte berb and the light copula element *ch* (Dasgupta, 2003: 372).

4. Participial passive
----------------------
"In that case, it becomes appropriate to state that Bangla has no grammatical passive, but can partly mimic the passive effect by using its experiencer subject construction." (Dasgupta, 2003: 376).

5. Dative external possessors
-----------------------------
Unclear from the source consulted, but it is likely that Bengali does not have DEPs (Haspelmath, 2001: 1498).

6. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation
------------------------------------------------
"In Bengali there are no negative adverbs or pronouns like 'never', 'no one', etc. so the affirmative forms are used with a negative verb." (Milne, 1993 [1913]: 216). In fact, Bengali expresses negation in this way slightly differently to the canonical SAE form: it effectively has verbal negation but no negative pronouns/adverbs, not the opposite which is what we would expect from a typical SAE language.

7. Relative-based equative constructions
----------------------------------------
Haspelmath (2001: 1500) states that "Impressionistically, relative-based equatives seem to be rare in the world's languages, and the eastern Indo-European languages do not seem to use them in general (however, a counterexample is Punjabi)." Supporting evidence has not been found in the source consulted, however.

8. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers
-----------------------------------------------------
Since personal pronouns "establish points on a formality scale" (Dasgupta, 2003: 367), it is highly unlikely that they can be omitted. However the "agreement that the verb exhibits with its subject for Person and Formality conflates 2PF (Second Person Formal) with 3PF, [...]." (idem.).

9. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation
----------------------------------------
No differentiation according to Haspelmath (2001: 1501). However, Milne suggests that there are two different forms: "Instead of [...] in the sense of "self" the words [...] and [...] are also very commonly used." (Milne, 1993 [1913]: 88).
