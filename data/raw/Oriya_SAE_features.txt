1. Definite and indefinite articles
-----------------------------------
Suffixes are used to make a singular or non-count noun definite. "In certain contexts, a singular noun or an uncount noun can also express definiteness even without a suffix [...]. For making plural nouns definite, usually a demonstrative pronoun is used [...]. The words or suffixes usually used for making a sungular noun indefinite are *jɔnə* 'one person'. *gote* 'one', *-te, -tie* and *-jane* is [sic] used with only human nouns; others are normally used with non-human nouns but they can also be used with human nouns." (Ray, 2003: 456-457).

2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns
------------------------------------------
"Relative clauses commonly used in Oriya are of the relative-correlative type. *jie*, *jeũmane*, *jeũta*, *jeũgudika*, etc. are usually used as the relative pronouns. [...] Like personal pronouns, they also have different case forms. *jeũ* is used as the modifier for the noun to be relativized. The relative cluase [...] usually precedes the main clause [...]. The relative clause, however, does not always precede the main clause [...]." (Ray, 2003: 469-470).

3. 'Have' perfect
-----------------
Tense and aspect are marked by verbal suffixes. (Ray, 2003: 458). Compound verb structures do exist, however, although not with auxiliaries, but rather suffixes indicating past time. (Ray, 2003: 464).

4. Participial passive
----------------------
"The passive verb in Oriya is formed with the passive participal and the passive auxiliary *-he-* 'to happen' or *-ja-* 'to go'. The passive participle is usually formed by adding the suffix *-a* to the verb root, or to a form derived from the verb root [...]." (Ray, 2003: 467). The auxiliary is a suffix, however, so the form is somewhat different to the canonical SAE participial passive. Furthermore, the formal passive has low acceptability in Oriya, with speakers preferring an impersonal passive form.

5. Dative external possessors
-----------------------------
Unclear from the source consulted, but it is likely that Oriya does not have DEPs (Haspelmath, 2001: 1498).

6. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation
------------------------------------------------
It is not clear from the source consulted whether Oriya lacks or possesses verbal negation. It is highly likely, however, that Oriya is of the type NI+NV since this is the type widely found in the eastern I-E languages (Indic and Iranian). (Haspelmath, 2001: 1498-1499).

7. Relative-based equative constructions
----------------------------------------
Not clear from the sources consulted, however Haspelmath (2001: 1500) states that "relative-based equatives seem to be rare in the world's languages, and the eastern Indo-European languages do not seem to use them in general [...]." It is quite likely, therefore, that Oriya does not possess them.

8. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers
-----------------------------------------------------
It isn't clear from the source consulted whether personal pronouns are obligatory or not.

9. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation
----------------------------------------
It isn't clear from the sources consulted, but Haspelmath (2001: 1501) states that "eastern Indo-European languages have the same expression for intensifiers and reflexives". The term for 'self' is *nijɔ*.
