Luxembourgish
=============

1. Definite and indefinite articles
-----------------------------------
Luxembourgish possesses both definite and indefinite articles. (Russ, 1996: 77-78).

2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns
------------------------------------------
"The role of the relative pronoun is generally taken by the demonstrative pronoun *dee(n)*, *dei*, *dat*, though *wat*, NHG *was* 'what' can appear for *dat*." (Russ, 1996: 84).

3. 'Have' perfect
-----------------
"Auxiliary verbs are used to help form tenses such as the perfect, future, conditional." (Russ, 1996: 88).

4. Participial passive
----------------------
"Lëtzebuergesch also distinguishes between these [NHG] two passive constructions. However, to form the actional passive the auxiliary *gi(n)*, NHG *geben* 'to give' is used [...]. The statal passive is formed with the verb *si(n)* [...]. The verb *gi(n)* also covers most senses of the NHG *werden* 'to become'." (Russ, 1996: 85).
