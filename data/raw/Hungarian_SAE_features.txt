Hungarian
=========

1. Definite and indefinite articles
-----------------------------------
The definite article is *a* and the indefinite article is *egy*. (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 256-258).

2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns
------------------------------------------
Relative clauses are marked by (phrases containing) relative pronouns, and the (phrase containing) the relative pronoun must be clause-initial. (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 27-28). "Prenominal relative clauses are nonfinite, marked on the clause-final  verb as an active ("present") or passive ("past") participle. [...] Postnominal relative clauses are marked by an optional demonstrative along with the lexical head noun and a (phrase containing the) obligatory relative pronoun in clause-initial position." (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 38).

3. 'Have' perfect
-----------------
There appears to be no periphrastic present perfect consturction in Hungarian. Only one past tense exists, and this is synthetic both for aspect and tense. (See, e.g., Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 294-297).

4. Participial passive
----------------------
"In the passive construction the lexical verb is in the adverbial participial (or 'simple converb') form (bearing the suffix *-va/ve*), and tense, person and number are marked on the copula." (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 283).

5. Dative external possessors
-----------------------------
An example of what appears to be dative external possession is found in Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi (1998: 159).

6. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation
------------------------------------------------
Universal negative polarity items such as *senki* 'nobody' and *semmi* 'nothing' require clausemate preverbal negation with the negative particle *nem/sem*. (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 116-117).

7. Relative-based equative constructions
----------------------------------------
"Equatives are solely expressed by means of the clausal construction intorduced by teh complementizer *mint* 'as, than' and a relative pro-form in the clause, and by various demonstrative items in the main clause." (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 155).

8. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers
-----------------------------------------------------
"Free pronouns are not obligatory in all circumstances." (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 260).

9. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation
----------------------------------------
"Reflexive pronouns are used as emphatic pronouns, occurring optionally together with the personal pronouns." (Kenesi, Vago & Fenyvesi, 1998: 272).
